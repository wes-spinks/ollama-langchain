3D Print Service Bureaus,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/3d-print-service-bureaus,"Our annual CIO survey found that 26% of the respondents have already deployed 3D printing or are planning for 3D printing.  Complicating the adoption of 3D printers by more organizations is the fact the price of enterprise-class devices ranges from $2,500 to over $2.5 million. Few companies will make significant investments without an acceptable ROI, which cannot be developed if 3D-printed pieces are not produced. Most manufacturing firms do not have the resources to own a variety of 3D printers of different technologies that may be occasionally used. For low-volume manufacturing and experimentation, 3D print service bureaus are an ideal solution for organizations that either cannot or do not want to be manufacturing. Indeed, these bureaus represent a new future for contract manufacturing. A practical alternative to making a significant investment is to engage with a 3D print service bureau.","['Quickparts', 'Ricoh 3D Print Service Bureaus', 'Materialise 3D Print Service Bureau', 'AMS 3D Printing Services', 'Aspect 3D Print Service Bureau', 'FATHOM 3D Print Service Bureau', 'Fast Radius On Demand Manufacturing', 'Protolabs 3D Print Service Bureau', 'Ricoh Rapid Fab 3D Print Service Bureau', 'Stratasys Direct Manufacturing 3D Print Service Bureau']"

4PLs,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/4pls,"A 4PL is a supply chain services provider that assumes managerial responsibility for the design, build, run, measurement and orchestration of an end-to-end logistics network on behalf of their customer for a fee. A 4PL manages and coordinates the physical execution of logistics operations via internal and/or external parties while delivering end-to-end visibility, management control and optimization via an integrated technology platform.
The growth in demand for 4PL partnerships is largely a result of the impact and ongoing risk that various disruptions pose to logistics networks and global supply chains. This increased focus on risk management has driven organizations to elevate the importance of integrating logistics into their supply chains on organizational, process and digital levels. Gone are the days when logistics was considered a poor relative of the supply chain family; on the contrary, logistics has come of age and has finally earned a well-deserved seat at the supply chain table.
The 4PL’s scope of managerial services spans the logistics needs of their customer. This means that the 4PL typically oversees internal company resources, 3PL providers, and carriers allowing their client to deal with one service provider as the central orchestrator. Typically, the transactional contractual agreements with the carriers and 3PLs in this scenario remain direct with the customer, and the 4PL is compensated via a management fee structure.
Some 4PLs are leveraging digitally enabled technology capabilities to help them orchestrate process integration between logistics and other supply chain functions. These enhancements can enable advanced capabilities in supply chain planning, sourcing and procurement, manufacturing, network design, and strategic planning.","['C.H.

Content is delivered through various modalities such as on-demand videos and courses, in-person facilitation and blended learning models. Top vendors in the market span from consultancies and coaches to nonprofits and e-learning providers.
With 93% of organizations conducting DEI training, it is a core component of overall DEI programming. DEI training serves a variety of primary purposes, including boosting awareness, facilitating skill development, creating and ultimately sustaining behavioral changes that are intended to advance DEI outcomes. Because poorly executed DEI training runs the risk of creating more divisiveness and disillusionment with DEI programming, most DEI training providers can consult with DEI leaders on content and delivery formats that best suit the needs of employees to yield relevant and valuable results that drive internal change.
As a consequence of building more inclusive environments through training, benefits to the business include meeting and going beyond training compliance standards; expanding talent attraction and retention (namely Gen Z and underrepresented talent who are more likely to both work at and stay at a company with strong DEI initiatives); increasing employee engagement; and cultivating cultures that are ripe for collaboration, creativity and innovation.

This market consists of applications that enable customer service and support to engage customers through their preferred digital channels, managing persistent dialogues. Digital first solutions treat those dialogues as the atomic unit of interaction, rather than defining it as a channel contact (e.g., an email or a call). This allows for channels and modalities (like voice, text or gestures) to become attributes of an interaction that can be flexibly and seamlessly used as appropriate.

Digital Evidence Management Systems,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/digital-evidence-management-systems,"Gartner defines DEMSs as products used by law enforcement and the courts to store, organize and share digital evidence artifacts while ensuring data integrity and chain-of-custody. DEMSs are software products delivered as SaaS and on-premises.
Digital evidence management systems (DEMSs) are used by policing agencies, prosecutors and courts to provide for the storage, organization and sharing of digital evidence artifacts. Generation of digital evidence has rapidly escalated as a result of officer body cameras, the use of technology in the course of illicit activities, and the many sources available to investigators, such as surveillance cameras and citizen imagery.
Traditional methods of email- and media-based transfer are inadequate for sharing the volume and complexity of digital evidence. The integrity of evidence must be ensured and be defensible in court. DEMSs ensure the evidence artifacts are unaltered and record the chain of custody. The need for this type of software product is not specific to any region or country. Law enforcement and courts exist around the globe and the need for DEMSs is universal to investigative and judicial processes. DEMS needs can vary by tier of government, but basic functionality remains constant with storage consumption as a primary differentiator. A large metro police force with thousands of body cameras in use will require more capacity than a smaller rural agency. It is not uncommon for policing agencies and prosecutors to share a common DEMS. However, courts are more likely to operate an independent system, as some features that might be more important to investigators, like AI-based video enhancement, citizen submission or mobile access, may not be essential for courts. Where a shared system does not exist, the transfer of information between police, prosecutors and courts is typically facilitated by the granting of an account in the target DEMS.","['CommandCentral Evidence', 'Digital Evidence Management Solution for Police']"

Digital Sales Rooms,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/digital-sales-rooms,"Gartner defines digital sales rooms (DSRs) as a digital channel designed to increase buyer and seller engagement throughout the customer journey via a privately formed persistent microsite. It uses a combination of revenue enablement content, e-commerce and workstream planning capabilities that align with buying jobs that need to be done. Customers or prospects can go through an entire buying cycle without speaking to a seller, but most tend to interact either asynchronously or live at critical decision points. With DSRs, the seller can provide personalized and relevant insights at various touchpoints to help the customer drive their buying journey.
The primary purpose of a DSR is for suppliers to provide a superior and more personalized buying experience when completing transactions, which improves revenue-generating outcomes. DSRs allow suppliers and customers to interact digitally presale, initial sale and post sale. All information pertaining to the purchase history of the solution or service remains intact and readily available. Seller and customer resources can swap in and out — for instance, the seller can leave the channel and have an account executive or customer success manager take over. Similarly, the customer’s buying executives can exit and their project and ongoing operations team comes in. This way, collaboration continues with a firm understanding of the history associated with an account. The buyer-seller relationship is strengthened, providing better lifetime value.","['DealHub DealRoom', 'GetAccept Contract Room', 'Pitcher']"
Digital Shelf Analytics,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/digital-shelf-analytics,"Gartner defines the digital shelf analytics (DSA) market as applications that provide brands and manufacturers with data from third-party digital channels where their products are sold, such as online marketplaces and retailers’ digital commerce sites. DSA applications provide SaaS-based dashboards that deliver data about products and insights for product data optimization.
When brands and manufacturers sell on third-party sites, they typically don’t have the insight needed for product data governance or product listing optimization, as the sites often only provide order and inventory reports.

Enterprise Architecture Tools,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/enterprise-architecture-tools,"Gartner defines the market for Enterprise Architecture Tools as tools that allow organizations to examine both the need for, and the impact of, change. They allow users to capture the interrelationships and interdependencies within and between an ecosystem of partners, operating models, capabilities, people, processes, information, and applications and technologies. They provide a central repository to capture data and metadata about the artifacts that an enterprise cares about, and their related life cycles. Models represent the relationships between these artifacts and are themselves treated as assets that help describe and shape the future of the enterprise.
EA tools provide a means to model the business and IT aspects of the enterprise in support of business outcome delivery. Doing so requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders across the organization — each playing a different role at a different time. The models and methods used by the stakeholders will vary depending on their role and must be integrated and connected to other models to be useful. To support these needs, EA tools have two aspects. The first provides a modeling environment, along with a supporting repository. The second facilitates collaboration between a diverse group of stakeholders across the organization, right from business strategy to IT.
A broad array of architectural and IT disciplines, such as business, information, solution, security, applications and infrastructure use EA tools. EA tools operate at many levels and across a wide spectrum to enable insights and support informed decision making.

Identity Verification,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/identity-verification,"Gartner defines identity verification as the combination of activities during a remote interaction that brings a real-world identity claim within organizational risk tolerances. Identity verification capabilities, delivered as SaaS or on-premises, provide the assurance that a real-world identity exists and that the individual claiming the identity is its true owner and genuinely present during a remote interaction.
The purpose of identity verification is to establish confidence in the identity of a person during a remote interaction when curated credentials do not exist, are not available or do not provide sufficient assurance. Identity verification is used for a variety of business purposes, such as:
- Compliance (e.g., know-your-customer obligations)
- Onboarding (e.g., customer registration, remote workforce hiring and employee onboarding processes)
- Account security (e.g., support for credential management processes, such as credential enrollment and account recovery)
- Mitigating fraud risk (e.g., preventing fraudulent registrations using stolen or synthetic identities, enabling remote proctoring/invigilation, and securing high-risk transactions)
- Trust and safety (e.g., improving accountability in marketplaces, providing assurance in the gig economy and establishing trust in larger identity networks)","['AuthenticID Identity Proofing', 'Genuine Presence Assurance', 'TrueID Document Authentication', 'Trulioo']"

- Workload isolation, which is isolation from other workloads based on security policy
- Policy enforcement, including the definition of rules based on different factors
- The ability to deploy in the virtualized and infrastructure as a service environments
Some of the most frequent optional capabilities of microsegmentation technologies include:
- Automation of the deployment as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Integration with cloud infrastructure to ease deployment, enforce rules or automate policy updates when new assets are deployed
- Asset discovery: adjacent to the flow mapping, microsegmentation tools can show more advanced context for the assets
- Policy recommendation engine: complementary to the asset discovery, microsegmentation technology can suggest policy rules to authorize discovered flows
- Threat detection: based on threat intelligence, layer seven protocol inspection and anomaly detection
- Interoperability through direct integration with third-party products, such as a firewall, and hardware, such as switches and routers

These platforms enable marketers to engage customers and prospects through a range of mobile-specific tactics — spanning mobile websites, mobile applications, smart device engagement, messaging (such as SMS and native applications), push notifications (such as on mobile apps and off websites), location-triggered interactions and mobile wallet cards. Mobile tactics are particularly suited to, for example, providing time-sensitive notifications to audiences, whether that’s in response to a live event, location-specific moment or a fulfillment update. MMPs also help measure and optimize the effectiveness of mobile strategy.
MMPs can operate as stand-alone solutions within a marketing organization’s tech stack, or operate alongside other marketing technology. These technologies can include a set of capabilities within a multichannel marketing hub (MMH), marketing automation platform (MAP), customer data platform (CDP) or other marketing automation applications. Stand-alone MMPs are a more specialized solution, often used in conjunction with an MMH, email platform or B2B MAP.","['MoEngage Customer Engagement Platform', 'Experience Cloud', 'Braze Customer Engagement Platform', 'Vibes Mobile Engagement Platform', 'Mobile Studio (Part of Marketing Cloud)', 'Leanplum mobile engagement platform', 'Punchh Marketing Cloud', 'Mobile Engagement Platform', 'Pyze Growth Intelligence Platform', 'Netcore Customer Engagement', 'Localytics Platform', 'Oracle Responsys (w/ Oracle Marketing Cloud)', 'CleverTap', 'Recurrency Platform', 'Swrve Platform', 'Webex Campaign', 'FollowAnalytics Mobile Marketing Automation Platform', 'Marigold Engage+', 'Digitalbox ADA', 'IBM Marketing Cloud (Legacy)', 'Xtremepush', 'SessionM Plaform', 'OneSignal', 'WebEngage', 'App Experience Platform', 'MobiLytix Rewards', 'MobiMesh']"

Penetration Testing Tools,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/penetration-testing,"Penetration Testing tools and services are designed to test vulnerabilities and weaknesses within computer systems and applications by simulating a cyber attack on a computer system, network, or web application. Companies conduct penetration tests to uncover new defects and test the security of communication channels and integrations.
These tools and services either use vulnerability scanners or conduct manual/automated tests that scan networks and systems for open ports, and services and conduct vulnerability assessments to find any software lapse that may prove a route of attack on the system later. Further, the identified vulnerabilities are exploited to gain unauthorized access to systems or data and they try to escalate or pivot to key assets to have a better understanding about the impact of a specific attack. The process ends with generating a detailed and comprehensive testing report that describes, gives evidence for, assesses the risk, and recommends the solution to any vulnerability found.
Typically these are used by security professionals and ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, understand how cyber attacks work, and test the effectiveness of security measures.","['RidgeBot', 'BreachLock Penetration Testing as a Service', 'Metasploit', 'Burp Suite Professional', 'AppCheck', 'NetSPI Penetration Testing Services', 'Astra', 'Pentest-Tools.com', 'Kroll Penetration Testing Services', 'GuidePoint Security Penetration Testing Services', 'Vumetric Penetration Testing Services', 'UnderDefense Penetration Testing', 'ScienceSoft Penetration Testing Services', 'Core Impact', 'X-Force Red Penetration Testing Services', 'Beagle Security', 'DigitSec', 'SAINT Security Suite', 'Heyhack Scan', 'Bishop Fox Penetration Testing Services', 'Indusface WAS', 'RedRays Security Platform']"

Discovery of existing information held on individuals, and continuous monitoring for changes to data stores and new systems that are being onboarded.
Maintenance of the capacity to act on that information should the data subject request modification, deletion or restriction of processing.
Tracking of request workflows and holding of detailed records to gauge effectiveness and demonstrate compliance.
Organizations face great challenges in sifting through structured and unstructured data stores — whether on-premises, in the cloud, or with partners and subprocessors.

User Research Platforms,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/user-research-platforms,"Gartner defines user research platforms as tools that help user experience (UX) professionals and product managers to recruit research participants, conduct evaluations, generate findings, and identify insights to digital product teams and stakeholders across disciplines.
User research platforms streamline the process of gathering, analyzing and interpreting information about the needs, motivations and behaviors of a target audience. These platforms are primarily cloud-based SaaS offerings and can be used by any organization that designs and builds digital products for end-user consumption.
For business leaders, building the wrong thing is just as risky as building the thing wrong. Software engineering teams are expensive, so dedicating the teams’ time and effort to poor product ideas or unwanted features is an enormous avoidable cost. User research platforms won’t make products perfect, but they will help teams to massively reduce the risks and costs associated with building software that frustrates users.
User research platforms also make it easier for UX teams to conduct user research early in the development process using prototypes and wireframes, and to repeat it often as the product develops. UX professionals can gather and communicate insights to engineering teams sprint-by-sprint. These platforms can analyze large sets of data so that teams can more easily translate insights into compelling stories to share with stakeholders.","['Alida Total Experience Management (TXM) platform', 'Discuss Platform']"

Win/Loss Analysis Providers,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/winloss-analysis-providers,"Win/loss analysis is a strategic business practice that seeks to understand the reasons why deals were won or lost, or led to no-decision scenarios. This could include product strengths/weaknesses, sales and marketing effectiveness, pricing, buying experience and company reputation. In B2B organizations with mature win/loss analysis practices, this commonly involves surveying and/or interviewing prospective buyers and customers after a sales cycle to understand why they chose an organization and its products/services over others they evaluated.
While some organizations choose to run their win/loss analysis programs in-house, others prefer to outsource this capability to third-party providers to minimize bias and pursue deeper insights. Win/loss analysis providers offer a wide range of qualitative and quantitative research solutions to help organizations surface detailed and actionable insights.
At its core, this is largely a service-led market — supported by software — to design, implement and deliver win/loss analysis services. However, software plays an increasingly important role in how these services are executed and how insights are delivered to clients.

At this point, Workday has risen to become a leading vendor in this particular sector of the software market. Workday initially released its Financial Management offering in 2008, and often sells it together with HCM. However, market adoption of Workday FM has been much slower than HCM, largely due to the slower takeup of SaaS in the finance domain. Also, to date, the majority of customers have been based in North America, although Workday FM is starting to gain ground in other geographies.

Workforce Management Applications,https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/workforce-management-applications,"WFM is a solution comprising software, services and (often) hardware that helps organizations manage the operational deployment of their workers. In most cases, WFM is deployed for hourly paid/blue-collar employees. The deployment of WFM for both hourly and salaried workers can be justified primarily in the following cases:
The organization wants both salaried and hourly workers to use the same absence management and/or access control system.
To capture the overtime of salaried workers and use that data to calculate gross pay.
When salaried workers are scheduled to work dynamic shifts, rather than set “office” hours.
When salaried workers must allocate and track their time to projects or tasks and a WFM system is already in use.

The core capabilities of WFM applications include:
Accurately measuring workers’ working time and absences and making this information available to payroll and other HR systems.
Delivering tools to assist employers in managing compliance with legislation and agreements pertaining to working time, pay and leave.
Providing a means of creating efficient and fair work schedules (sometimes referred to as rotas or rosters) and providing tools to track worker productivity.","['Zoho People', 'ADP Time & Attendance', 'UKG Pro Workforce Management', 'When I Work', 'Enterprise eTIME (Legacy)', 'greytHR', 'Rippling', 'Ceridian Dayforce', 'Humanity Scheduling', 'WorkForce Suite', 'UKG Ready', 'TimeClock Plus', 'ADP Workforce Now', 'Workforce.com', 'Infor WFM', 'SumTotal', 'Luminate Commerce', 'Remotedesk', 'Protime Premium', 'Indeavor', 'Connect HR', 'Infinity Zucchetti', 'Replicon Project Time Tracking', 'Workware+ (Legacy)', 'Connecteam', 'Ramco Global Payroll', 'Workmate', 'tamigo', 'Asanify Platform', 'ProMark', 'Quinyx', 'SISQUAL WFM', 'WorkJam', 'Prometheus Platform', 'TimeCheck', 'HR WORKS', 'Pocket HRMS', 'Synerion', 'nimbus Time2Work', 'AccountSight', 'Beamible', 'Compport', 'Crown', 'Deputy', 'Humanforce', 'KloudGin Platform', 'Legion Workforce Management Platform', 'MakeShift', 'Mekari Talenta', 'Plannam HRP', 'Quorbit', 'RosterElf', 'Shiftee', 'Tanda', 'WorkAxle Workforce Management', 'inConcert Workforce Engagement']"
